# Systems Interview Preperation

This repository is notes for linux, networking and operating systems concepts

The SRE interview generally contains of a majority of systems knowledge, a little of leetcode
style algorithmic questions, a networking round and a debugging round. Let us talk about each of these rounds a bit

**Leetcode Round**
This the most common round and I do not think I need to write much about it, in detail. This round is a combination of leetcode questions ranging in diffculty from easy to medium hard. I have rarely read or heard of leetcode hard questions asked in an SRE interview, but some companies do ask hard questions. In my opinion that would not be testing for the right set of skills. Instead bordering on the easy to medium range would ideally be the range of difficulty.

**Systems Round/Linux Round/OS Round**
The most important round in the SRE interview is the systems round. This round would mostly consist of knowledge of linux internals. Having a deep understanding of operating systems and linux is necessary to excel in this round. If you have a formal education there is a high chance you might have taken an operating system course in your undergrad years. If not, this repository is the right place for you, I have explained most of the concepts you would need to clear an SRE round. Even if you have the necessary knowledge, going through this would be a good refresher. 

**Networking Round**
Some of the big tech companies do hold a separate networking round, and some companies have this round mixed up with the systems round. Either way having really strong networking fundamentals would be necessary to be able to clear any SRE round. I have summarized this section as well in this repository. 

**Debugging Round**
This is a rare round, and having a separate round for this is not the norm, the range of type of questions asked here is really limited, and you just need to have some understanding of how systems work to be able to clear a debugging round. I have written about this round as well as the type of questions you would face.
